various projects, such as the space shuttle. One of its projects is to
create Workflow Automation System (WAS), an application designed to
manage NASA and other third-party projects. The setup uses a central
Oracle database as a repository for information. Python was chosen over
languages such as Java and C++ because it provides dynamic typing and
pseudo-codeâ€“like syntax and it has an interpreter. The result is that
the application is developed faster, and unit testing each piece is easier."""
